## Description
GameRank is a web application designed to build a community among gamers and those that aspire to be so. The app serves as a space for users to share their ideas on games they have played and view the ideas shared by others. With over 500,000 games available to rate, we are hoping GameRank encourages more discussion when it comes to gaming experiences.
